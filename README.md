# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the text content. This analysis can be used for various applications such as market research, social media monitoring, and public opinion analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - numpy
   - nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn

## Dataset
Ensure your Twitter dataset is in CSV format, containing a column with tweet texts and a column with sentiment labels (e.g., Sentiment). You can either use a pre-existing dataset or collect your own using the Twitter API.

## Usage
- Prepare your data:
   - Ensure your data is clean and properly formatted.
   - Preprocess the tweet texts (e.g., remove stop words, tokenize, stemming/lemmatization).
- Run the sentiment analysis
- Visualize the results


## Evaluation
The performance of the sentiment analysis model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics can be obtained using the classification_report from scikit-learn.

## Conclusion
This sentiment analysis project provides a robust approach to understanding the sentiment of tweets based on their text content. By analyzing the sentiment of tweets, businesses and researchers can gain valuable insights into public opinion and social media trends.
